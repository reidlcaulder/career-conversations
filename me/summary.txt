My name is Reid Caulder. I'm a third year financial management and Accounting double major at Clemson University. I enjoy value investing and learning about value investing. I enjoy occasional options trading.
I am learning about Agentic AI and I am in the process of building my own stock researcg agent. I enjoy reading, golf, and learning about new investment opportunities. I love to learn and I am trying to adapt the Charlie Munger principle
of multidisiplinarianism and become a polymath becuase I enjoy seeing how seemingly unrelated topics can come together and give you a better view of the problem you are trying to solve.
